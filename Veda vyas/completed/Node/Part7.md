1. [x] Why do we use `prototype` and `__proto__` in JavaScript? What are the key differences between them, what problems do they solve, why do we need them, and what was used before prototypes were introduced? and how to make this both pointing to one place and how we check both are equal
   
2. [x] Given a nested array, without using `flat()` or any other built-in flattening methods, write a program to convert it into a single-level array.

3. [x]  **What is the difference between JavaScript (JS) and JSX?**
    
4. [x]  **What is the global object in Node.js vs. the browser environment?**
       
5. [x] What is `globalThis` in JavaScript? How does it differ between Node.js and the browser environment, and can you give examples of APIs provided by each runtime?
    
6. [x]   **How do arrow functions differ from regular (normal) functions in JavaScript?**
    
7. [x]   **What are closures in JavaScript and how do they work?**
    
8. [x]   **Can we implement a class using closures in JavaScript?**
       
9. [x] What is the difference between using closures vs `#private` class fields to create private variables in JavaScript? Can you provide examples of both and explain why `p1.#name` throws a SyntaxError, while closure-based variables behave differently?
    
10. [x]   **How can we create private variables inside a JavaScript class?**
    
11. [x]   **What is the Node.js File System (fs) module and how does it work?**
        
12. [x] In Node.js, what does specifying `'utf8'` encoding in `fs.readFile()` do, and how does it differ from reading the file without specifying an encoding?
    
13. [x]   **What are all the common ways to create a new object in JavaScript?**
    
14. [x]   **What is prototype-based inheritance in JavaScript and how does it work?**
    
15. [x]   **What is PM2 and how is it used for process management in Node.js?**
    
16. [x]   **What is the V8 engine and how does it power JavaScript execution?**
    
17. [x]   **What are the differences between `var`, `let`, and `const` in terms of scoping and behavior inside loops?**
    
18. [x]   **Why does `NaN == NaN` return false, while `undefined == null` returns true, and why does coercion not apply to `NaN` comparisons?**
